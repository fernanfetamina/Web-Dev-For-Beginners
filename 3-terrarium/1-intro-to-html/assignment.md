# Practice your HTML: Build a blog mockup

## Instructions

Imagine you are designing, or redesigning, your personal web site. Create a graphical mockup of your site, and then write down the HTML markup you would use to build out the various elements of the site. You can do this on paper, and scan it, or use software of your choice, just make sure to hand-code the HTML markup.

<h2> Embark on the journey </h2>
<p>Gathering the courage to say goodbye<br>
  Not dwelling on regrets<br>
  Forgetting everything and seeking a new future<br>
  Hoping that everything will be better<br>
  Shouting to the four winds that you no longer belong there<br>
  Facing the universe<br>
  Looking at yourself in the mirror</p>


<h2> Dark night </h2>
<p> In darkness again?<br>
  Forced smile as tears fall from the eyes<br>
  How many more times will we fall into this place?<br>
  Why doesn't the spider let us go?<br>
  We fall into its web again and again<br>
  We lose hope...<br>
  We suffer<br>
  We cry<br>
  We wish to die<br>
  If it wants us dead, let it devour us at once<br>
  Don't torture us any longer</p>

<h2> Say goodbye </h2>
<p> She owes you nothing<br>
  Leave her alone, she's had enough<br>
  Her demons have consumed her soul<br>
  Her mind is shattered<br>
  And sometimes, in those brief moments of sanity...<br>
  Only tears flow<br>
  Realizing how rotten it all is<br>
  She wants nothing from you<br>
  Nor from this world<br>
  Say goodbye.</p>
